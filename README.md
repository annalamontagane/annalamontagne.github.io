Site Navigation 
This site is organized into a simple structure with only the home page and navigation page. Which can be navigated between with the header in the top right hand corner of both pages. External navigation to email and linkden can also be accessed in the header. 

The home page displays my work experience, which can be hovered on to see more in depth photos on desktop & tablet screens.  The rest of the information can be easily read through. 

The visulaization page has two interactions. The first for svg art when the user can generate and regenerate a flower garden by pressing on the "click me". The second interaction allows the user to switch between data sets displayed on the bar chart.
